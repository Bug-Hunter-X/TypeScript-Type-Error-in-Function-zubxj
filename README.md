# TypeScript Type Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where an incorrect type is passed to a function. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to pass two strings.  The TypeScript compiler will report this error. The solution demonstrates how to properly type check inputs and handle potential errors.
